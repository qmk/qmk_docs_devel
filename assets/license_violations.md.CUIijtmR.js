This includes any of the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>Use of public QMK Firmware, but with &quot;closed source&quot; privately-held board definitions</li><li>Vendor-customised QMK Firmware, which the vendor keeps private for building their own boards</li><li>Any other non-QMK firmware which includes portions of QMK Firmware, such as adaptation of <code>via.c</code> into any other non-QMK firmware, even if used as a reference when translated to another programming language.</li></ul><p>As per the GPL license requirements, vendors must provide entire source code for the as-shipped firmware.</p><p>QMK has traditionally been lenient with this clause -- providing source code to the QMK community is necessary but reproducing the exact build may not be possible. QMK has required functionally-equivalent source code to be made available. In rare cases exact code may be requested; vendors must keep copies regardless.</p><p>At minimum, vendors must provide the source code through some distribution mechanism. This could potentially be an clearly available downloadable copy of the code online, a fork of QMK Firmware, or even a DVD accompanying the product in the box.</p><p>If sources are unable to be provided in a timely fashion, QMK may revoke the vendor&#39;s license, effectively rendering them unable to leverage QMK.</p><p>Vendors choosing to keep things closed-source because of a desire to have a &quot;competitive edge&quot; compared to other vendors is unacceptable to both QMK and the community, and is a breach of the QMK license. There&#39;s no reason to do so; any new or interesting vendor-specific feature will be quickly replicated by other vendors or the community anyway.</p><h2 id="qmk-pr-considerations" tabindex="-1">QMK PR Considerations <a class="header-anchor" href="#qmk-pr-considerations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;QMK PR Considerations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Vendors who submit PRs to QMK Firmware whilst not providing full sources for all of their license-violating boards will be put on hold until source code for all violating boards is provided. Intentional deception may result in boards being removed from QMK and all future PRs for that manufacturer being denied outright.</p><p>Submitting crippled source code in order to attain a merge into QMK Firmware to pave the way for VIA support is unacceptable. This includes submitting a wired-only firmware for a wireless-capable board, or any other PR which does not include key features as-advertised.</p><p>Reusing the <code>VID</code> and <code>PID</code> for multiple boards (such as for two variants, wired and wireless) is an unacceptable scenario as this creates confusion for support. Many customers have flashed boards with the wrong firmware, which could have been avoided if vendors were obvious about their board identification mechanisms.</p><p>If there is sufficient ambiguity about a board, supporting evidence will need to be presented to the QMK team. This may include impartial third parties who can demonstrate a board&#39;s existence and can confirm its feature set, such as well-known content producers; popular review sites or notable video creators may be leveraged. If such evidence is unavailable, as a last resort the vendor may be required to ship a fully functional board in full retail packaging to QMK maintainers for verification. Engineering samples will not be accepted, as one-off boards have been deceptively used in the past.</p><p>PRs submitted to upstream QMK should not expect an instant merge just because source code has been provided -- code from OEMs has historically been of a quality lower than QMK standards, so as per the <a href="./pr_checklist">PR checklist</a> submitters should make the changes as small as possible and be prepared to change their implementation.</p><h2 id="detection" tabindex="-1">Detection <a class="header-anchor" href="#detection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Detection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If the QMK team identifies or is informed of a license violation from a vendor:</p><ul><li>Any current and future PRs for that vendor will be indefinitely put on hold, preventing merge into QMK Firmware, thus preventing any out-of-the-box VIA support</li><li>Any existing keyboards from the vendor may be removed from QMK Firmware</li><li>Vendors will be added to the <em>offending vendors</em> list above</li></ul><p>Repeated violations may result in that vendor being disallowed from contributing the QMK in its entirety. In the worst case, the QMK team may choose to revoke a vendor&#39;s license to use QMK Firmware outright.</p><h2 id="remediation" tabindex="-1">Remediation <a class="header-anchor" href="#remediation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Remediation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Vendors must provide fully-featured source code for each of their identified violations, matching the feature capabilities of their as-shipped products. This will usually be in their own fork of QMK Firmware while awaiting a merge into upstream.</p><p>Once all identified violations have been remediated, current and future PRs will no longer be on hold and the vendor will be removed from the offending vendors list above.</p>', 32);

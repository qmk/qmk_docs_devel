QMK started as <a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Jack Humbert</a>&#39;s fork of TMK for the Planck. After a while Jack&#39;s fork had diverged quite a bit from TMK, and in 2015 Jack decided to rename his fork to QMK.</p><p>From a technical standpoint QMK builds upon TMK by adding several new features. Most notably QMK has expanded the number of available keycodes and uses these to implement advanced features like <code>S()</code>, <code>LCTL()</code>, and <code>MO()</code>. You can see a complete list of these keycodes in <a href="./keycodes">Keycodes</a>.</p><p>From a project and community management standpoint TMK maintains all the officially supported keyboards by himself, with a bit of community support. Separate community maintained forks exist or can be created for other keyboards. Only a few keymaps are provided by default, so users typically don&#39;t share keymaps with each other. QMK encourages sharing of both keyboards and keymaps through a centrally managed repository, accepting all pull requests that follow the quality standards. These are mostly community maintained, but the QMK team also helps when necessary.</p><p>Both approaches have their merits and their drawbacks, and code flows freely between TMK and QMK when it makes sense.</p>', 27);

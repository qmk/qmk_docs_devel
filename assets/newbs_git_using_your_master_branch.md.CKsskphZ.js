Instead, do all your changes in a development branch and issue pull requests from your branches when you&#39;re developing.</p><p>To reduce the chances of merge conflicts — instances where two or more users have edited the same part of a file concurrently — keep your <code>master</code> branch relatively up-to-date, and start any new developments by creating a new branch.</p><h2 id="updating-your-master-branch" tabindex="-1">Updating your master branch <a class="header-anchor" href="#updating-your-master-branch" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Updating your master branch&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To keep your <code>master</code> branch updated, it is recommended to add the QMK Firmware repository (&quot;repo&quot;) as a remote repository in git. To do this, open your Git command line interface and enter:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>git remote add upstream https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>The name <code>upstream</code> is arbitrary, but a common convention; you can give the QMK remote any name that suits you. Git&#39;s <code>remote</code> command uses the syntax <code>git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> being shorthand for the remote repo. This name can be used with many Git commands, including but not limited to <code>fetch</code>, <code>pull</code> and <code>push</code>, to specify the remote repo on which to act.</p></div><p>To verify that the repository has been added, run <code>git remote -v</code>, which should return the following:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>$ git remote -v</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>origin  https://github.com/&lt;your_username&gt;/qmk_firmware.git (fetch)</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>origin  https://github.com/&lt;your_username&gt;/qmk_firmware.git (push)</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>upstream        https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git (fetch)</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>upstream        https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git (push)</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that this is done, you can check for updates to the repo by running <code>git fetch upstream</code>. This retrieves the branches and tags — collectively referred to as &quot;refs&quot; — from the QMK repo, which now has the nickname <code>upstream</code>. We can now compare the data on our fork <code>origin</code> to that held by QMK.</p><p>To update your fork&#39;s master, run the following, hitting the Enter key after each line:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>git checkout master</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>git fetch upstream</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>git pull upstream master</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>git push origin master</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This switches you to your <code>master</code> branch, retrieves the refs from the QMK repo, downloads the current QMK <code>master</code> branch to your computer, and then uploads it to your fork.</p><h2 id="making-changes" tabindex="-1">Making Changes <a class="header-anchor" href="#making-changes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Making Changes {#making-changes}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To make changes, create a new branch by entering:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>git checkout -b dev_branch</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>git push --set-upstream origin dev_branch</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This creates a new branch named <code>dev_branch</code>, checks it out, and then saves the new branch to your fork. The <code>--set-upstream</code> argument tells git to use your fork and the <code>dev_branch</code> branch every time you use <code>git push</code> or <code>git pull</code> from this branch. It only needs to be used on the first push; after that, you can safely use <code>git push</code> or <code>git pull</code>, without the rest of the arguments.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>With <code>git push</code>, you can use <code>-u</code> in place of <code>--set-upstream</code> — <code>-u</code> is an alias for <code>--set-upstream</code>.</p></div><p>You can name your branch nearly anything you want, though it is recommended to name it something related to the changes you are going to make.</p><p>By default <code>git checkout -b</code> will base your new branch on the branch that is currently checked out. You can base your new branch on an existing branch that is not checked out by adding the name of the existing branch to the command:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>git checkout -b dev_branch master</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that you have a development branch, open your text editor and make whatever changes you need to make. It is recommended to make many small commits to your branch; that way, any change that causes issues can be more easily traced and undone if needed. To make your changes, edit and save any files that need to be updated, add them to Git&#39;s <em>staging area</em>, and then commit them to your branch:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>git add path/to/updated_file</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>git commit -m &quot;My commit message.&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>git add</code> adds files that have been changed to Git&#39;s <em>staging area</em>, which is Git&#39;s &quot;loading zone.&quot; This contains the changes that are going to be <em>committed</em> by <code>git commit</code>, which saves the changes to the repo. Use descriptive commit messages so you can know what was changed at a glance.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>If you&#39;ve changed multiple files, you can use <code>git add -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2 ...</code> to add all your desired files.</p></div><h2 id="publishing-your-changes" tabindex="-1">Publishing Your Changes <a class="header-anchor" href="#publishing-your-changes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Publishing Your Changes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The last step is to push your changes to your fork. To do this, enter <code>git push</code>. Git will then publish the current state of <code>dev_branch</code> to your fork.</p>', 27);

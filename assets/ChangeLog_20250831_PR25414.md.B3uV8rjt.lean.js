This feature has been demonstrated to enable unauthorized keystroke capture, with documented examples showing how malicious scripts could exploit this capability to create keyloggers. A recent security assessment revealed that user credentials could be compromised by exploiting the matrix testing function combined with VIA's keycode assignment queries. In this attack scenario, a script could remain active during a locked session and capture password input when users authenticate upon return.", -1);

Given the severity of the potential security implications and the lack of engagement from the VIA team, the QMK team has unilaterally implemented a security enhancement that modifies the keyboard matrix testing functionality to prevent the reporting of key press events. This change prioritizes user security and data protection over potential feature compatibility concerns within VIA.", -1);

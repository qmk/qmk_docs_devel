Some include employing additional hardware, for example an RC filter, while there are various ways to do debouncing in software too, often called debounce algorithms. This page discusses software debouncing methods available in QMK.</p><p>While technically not considered contact bounce/contact chatter, some switch technologies are susceptible to noise, meaning, while the key is not changing state, sometimes short random 0-&gt;1 or 1-&gt;0 transitions might be read by the digital circuit, for example:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>                  +-+</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>                  | |</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>                  | |</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span>+-----------------+ +--------------------</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Many debounce methods (but not all) will also make the device resistant to noise. If you are working with a technology that is susceptible to noise, you must choose a debounce method that will also mitigate noise for you.</p><h2 id="types-of-debounce-algorithms" tabindex="-1">Types of debounce algorithms <a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-debounce-algorithms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Types of debounce algorithms&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Unit of time: Timestamp (milliseconds) vs Cycles (scans)</p><ul><li>Debounce algorithms often have a &#39;debounce time&#39; parameter, that specifies the maximum settling time of the switch contacts. This time might be measured in various units: <ul><li>Cycles-based debouncing waits n cycles (scans), decreasing count by one each matrix_scan</li><li>Timestamp-based debouncing stores the millisecond timestamp a change occurred, and does substraction to figure out time elapsed.</li></ul></li><li>Timestamp-based debouncing is usually superior, especially in the case of noise-resistant devices because settling times of physical switches is specified in units of time, and should not depend on the matrix scan-rate of the keyboard.</li><li>Cycles-based debouncing is sometimes considered inferior, because the settling time that it is able to compensate for depends on the performance of the matrix scanning code. If you use cycles-based debouncing, and you significantly improve the performance of your scanning code, you might end up with less effective debouncing. A situation in which cycles-based debouncing might be preferable is when noise is present, and the scanning algorithm is slow, or variable speed. Even if your debounce algorithm is fundamentally noise-resistant, if the scanning is slow, and you are using a timestamp-based algorithm, you might end up making a debouncing decision based on only two sampled values, which will limit the noise-resistance of the algorithm.</li><li>Currently all built-in debounce algorithms support timestamp-based debouncing only. In the future we might implement cycles-based debouncing, and it will be selectable via a <code>config.h</code> macro.</li></ul></li><li><p>Symmetric vs Asymmetric</p><ul><li>Symmetric - apply the same debouncing algorithm, to both key-up and key-down events. <ul><li>Recommended naming convention: <code>sym_*</code></li></ul></li><li>Asymmetric - apply different debouncing algorithms to key-down and key-up events.
